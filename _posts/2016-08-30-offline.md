Subj. 

BTW, here is a pre-pre-pre-alpha of my own console with chess and postgraduate student girls:

![](/images/2016-08-30-sigma_console_pre_alpha.png)<!-- more -->

Features:

* easily extendable (just create a `*.py` file with a simple-structured class inside -- and you got a new command)
* have initial commands? put them to `.sigma_init` file and the commands will be executed one-by-one while before the console prompt appeared
* few commands, `os`, `version`, `colors`, `exit` (or just press `Ctrl+D` for exit)

That's all, at the moment. Sources will come soon. May be :)
